        text: "We believe in making long-lasting relationships, although you are getting a one-day production experience, we can be part of many moments of your life if you want it! We know, it sounds cliché, but to call you “Customer” Feels kind of value-less for us. We want our company to be part of your memories, and for this to happen, we need to work together so we can make your dreams come true, and once we work together we become, indeed, Partners."

        title: "3.Why do we require a deposit? ",
        text: "We love to create experiences based on every event, sometimes that requires even extra equipments (Specially props), plus, we are reserving a date and time for your event and it is not just the hours you book, we need at least 2 hours before your event to get to the place and install our equipment, and also (At least) An extra hour after the event to edit your videos and complete your experience. This leaves us tied up to just one event per day most of the time and we need to guarantee our business expenses are covered in case anything happens."

        title: "4.How can I assure my event is confirmed after I paid the deposit?",
        text: "You will receive a contract once we receive your deposit stating all our terms and conditions, agreements and specifications which should be signed within 48 hours after it has been sent. You will receive a reminder in case it has not been signed after 24 hours, after 36 hours and the last one after 44 hours."

        title: "5.Do I get my deposit back?",
        text: "Your deposit goes towards the total of your booking, meaning that your next payment will only be the remaining balance."
